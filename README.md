Dependency Resolver

You are given a list of tasks and their dependencies.
Each task can run only after all its dependencies are completed.

Your system should:

Validate whether the dependencies are valid (no circular dependency)

If valid, return a correct execution order of tasks

If invalid, clearly report a circular dependency error

## Visual Style Guide — Orchestra

### Purpose

The visual style of Orchestra supports **focus, correctness, and trust**.
The UI should feel calm, predictable, and invisible during extended use.

---

## Style Archetype

**Minimal, utilitarian developer tool**

Inspired by:

* internal dashboards
* workflow engines
* execution monitors

Not inspired by:

* marketing sites
* playful SaaS
* experimental UI trends

---

## Core Style Principles

### 1. Clarity Over Personality

The interface exists to communicate structure and execution state.

### 2. Intent Before Interaction

Users act based on goals, not UI affordances.

### 3. Predictability

UI behavior should never surprise the user.

### 4. Low Visual Noise

Decoration is minimized to reduce cognitive load.

---

## Layout Guidelines

* Vertical, top-to-bottom flow
* Clear section separation
* Predictable spacing
* No hidden interactions
* No modal-heavy navigation

---

## Components

### Cards & Panels

* Flat or lightly elevated
* Subtle borders
* No heavy shadows

### Buttons

* Clear primary action
* Neutral secondary actions
* Minimal animation

### Inputs

* Clearly labeled
* Visible focus states
* Immediate validation

---

## Execution UI

Execution is the most important state.

Execution UI must:

* show what is running
* show why something is blocked
* show what failed and why
* stream output clearly

Terminal panels should:

* open and close dynamically
* be clearly labeled
* never overwhelm the UI

---

## Interaction & Motion

* Motion should be minimal
* No decorative animations
* Transitions should be subtle and functional

---

## What to Avoid

* Glassmorphism
* Neumorphism
* Overuse of animations
* Dense visual decoration
* Graph visualizations as primary UI

---

## Accessibility

* Sufficient contrast
* Clear focus indicators
* Status never conveyed by color alone
* Readable font sizes at all times

---

## Design Intent

> The UI should feel calm, reliable, and invisible — allowing users to focus entirely on their workflows.

---

### Final Note

These documents define **intent**, not just appearance.
As long as the UI follows these principles, visual changes will remain consistent and correct.
